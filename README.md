# About This
A couple of simple chrome extensions that I wanted to save. Both made for the purpose of solving some programming questions. The counter for keeping track of the number of problems I've solved in a certain playlist, and the other for timing how long it takes.

### How to install these extensions?
To add these extensions to your browser, simply install each folder. Then, open your browser and type in "chrome://extensions", and on the top right, toggle Developer Mode. Then, a mini developer menu should ease down into the window. Click on "Load unpacked", and select the corresponding folder.
